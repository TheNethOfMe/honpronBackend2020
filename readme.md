# Honest Piranha Backend 2020

> A new and improved version of the backend API for my landing page where I display my podcasts and other game-related content.

## Usage

This API can be reconfigured for your own needs, or you can just play around with it as-is if you'd like. 

Either way, you'll need to rename "config/config.env.env" to just "config.env" and update the values/settings to your own.

## Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Run App


```
# Run in dev mode
npm run dev
